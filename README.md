# Vehicle Telematics Analysis with Apache Flink

This project employs Apache Flink, a powerful stream processing framework, to conduct an insightful analysis of vehicle telematics data. By processing historical traffic data, the system is designed to identify speeding violations, calculate average speeds over specific road segments, and detect potential stationary vehicle incidents that may indicate accidents.

## Initial Configuration and Data Reading

The journey begins by setting up the Apache Flink execution environment, specifying parameters such as the level of parallelism and the event time mode to effectively process the data streams. The system reads input from a specified file containing vehicle telematics data, laying the groundwork for the subsequent analysis.

## Data Processing and Transformations

The core of the project lies in its sophisticated data processing and transformation stages, structured as follows:

### SpeedRadar

This component filters the dataset to pinpoint vehicles exceeding a speed threshold of 90 mph. These instances are then formatted appropriately for further analysis, highlighting potential speeding violations.

### AverageSpeedControl

Focusing on specific highway segments (specifically, segments 52 to 56), this stage calculates the average speed of vehicles traversing these areas. Vehicles with average speeds exceeding 60 mph are flagged, indicating possible infractions regarding average speed limits.

### AccidentReporter

A critical safety feature, this component detects vehicles that remain stationary (speed 0) across four consecutive reports, spaced 30 seconds apart, totaling a duration of 90 seconds. Such patterns may signify the occurrence of accidents, warranting further investigation.

## Data Output

The analysis culminates in the generation of three distinct CSV files, encapsulating:

- Speeding violations.
- Average speed infractions.
- Potential accident reports.

Leveraging ascending time stamps, the Flink environment adeptly handles temporal windows and event-time processing. This methodology enables a granular and temporal examination of traffic data, which is paramount for identifying speeding offenses and possible accident scenarios.

## Conclusion

This project harnesses Apache Flink's real-time data stream processing capabilities to derive valuable insights from vehicle telematics data. The applications of this analysis extend to traffic management, road safety, and urban planning, showcasing the practical benefits of real-time data processing in addressing contemporary challenges in vehicular mobility and infrastructure utilization.
